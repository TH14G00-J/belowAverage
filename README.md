# Below Average

This project is a simple Java program that reads a list of real numbers, calculates their average, 
and then displays the elements that are below this average.

## Problem Description

The program asks the user how many elements the array will have (N). 
Then it reads N real numbers, calculates the arithmetic average of all elements, 
and prints this value with three decimal places. 
After that, it prints all elements that are below the average, with one decimal place each.

### Example

Input / Output example:

How many elements will the array have? 4
Enter a number: 10.0
Enter a number: 15.5
Enter a number: 13.2
Enter a number: 9.8
ARRAY AVERAGE = 12.125
ELEMENTS BELOW AVERAGE:
10.0
9.8
